# Guide to Machine Learning with Python
Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field. It is a prominent topic in Artificial Intelligence domain and has been in the spotlight for quite some time now.
Iâ€™m trying to gather all the information for each ML sub-section along with useful resources in each folder of this repository, one topic at a time!

### Sub topics covered:
- Data Pre-processing

### Collaborations
- Fork the Project
- Create a separate branch (git checkout -b sub-topic)
- Commit your Changes (git commit -m "ML Sub Topic")
- Push your changes (git push origin sub-topic)
- Open a Pull Request
> *Every sub-section should be implemented in a relevant folder. In case there is no implementation of the sub-topic, feel free to create a new one!* :beers:
